                        <p className="card-text">Throughout the last few years, many car enthusiasts have started turning their attention to recent vehicles – cars from the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond. Automotive reviewer UI mentor realized there isn’t yet a specific place that’s focused solely on buying and selling these modern enthusiast cars, but there should be – so he and a team created Cartrader, with its simple name modeled after Doug’s famous pursuit of “quirks and features.”
                        Cartrader is the best online auction marketplace to buy and sell modern enthusiast cars – and that means pretty much anything that’s cool from the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, or 2020s. To us, “cool” ranges from the obvious (a Ferrari F355 or a Lamborghini Gallardo) to the esoteric (a pristine Dodge Dakota Convertible or a Mercury Capri XR2) to the traditional fun cars that enthusiasts love (a Mazda MX-5 Miata or a Porsche 911). Basically everything that’s exciting, fun, interesting, or quirky is welcome here – as long as it comes from the modern era.
                        Although there are many places to buy and sell a special car, Cartrader offers significant advantages over other websites. <strong>Here are just a few of our benefits:</strong>
                        </p>
                        <ul className="list-group list-group-flush">
                            <li className="list-group-item"><strong>We’re focused on modern enthusiast cars:</strong> the 1980s to the 2020s. That means anyone interested in the next era of exciting cars will come here first to buy and sell.</li>
                            <li className="list-group-item"><strong>Our fees are low.</strong> The buyer’s fee is 4.5%, with a minimum of $225 and a maximum of $4,500 – far below other auction houses and enthusiast car auction websites. Our seller’s fee ranges from $49 for a no-reserve auction or a repeat seller to $89 for a first-time seller with a reserve auction.</li>
                            <li className="list-group-item"><strong>We believe that every vehicle should come with a vehicle history report </strong>– so we provide one, for free, instead of asking sellers to pay for their own.</li>
                            <li className="list-group-item"><strong>Doug DeMuro will bring extra eyes – and extra buyers – to your cars, </strong>periodically reviewing cars offered on Cars & Bids. If your car is chosen, you’ll get far more eyes on your vehicle than any other auction platform on earth.</li>
                            <li className="list-group-item">While other car auctions take weeks or even months to get your car listed and available to buyers, <strong>we’ll get your car listed quickly</strong> – and we’ll even take your input on scheduling your car’s auction.</li>
                            <li className="list-group-item"><strong>Cars & Bids makes it easy to submit your car for sale.</strong> We value your time by asking for only a few crucial details before letting you know whether or not we’re accepting your vehicle. That means you don’t have to waste your time providing initial information only to have your car rejected.</li>
                            <li className="list-group-item"><strong>Cars & Bids is the most user-friendly online automotive marketplace,</strong> with easy sorting and searching – and simplified auctions that tell you exactly what you need to know about each vehicle.</li>
                            <li className="list-group-item">If you sell a car with Cars & Bids and the high bidder doesn’t follow through on buying it, we’ll do our best to make sure your time hasn’t been wasted. We’ll try to collect a commission from the buyer – and if we’re successful, we’ll give you half of what we collect. That way, you still earn a little money from the time you’ve devoted to your auction. Of course, we’ll also re-list your car for free so it can find another buyer.</li>
